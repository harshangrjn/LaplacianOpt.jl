# Examples for LaplacianOpt
`run_examples.jl` file contains the main driver file which can be executed to synthesize an optimal graph with maximum algebraic connectivity, for a given weighted graph. Multiple weighted complete graphs can be used as instances in the `instances` folder. Overall run times for the formulated MISDPs with outer-approximation algorithms perform best in the [CPLEX](https://github.com/jump-dev/CPLEX.jl) (version 22.1) solver.
